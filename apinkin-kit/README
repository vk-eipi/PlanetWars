MyBot.py is a sample bot - feel free to modify and test your changes.

Requirements:

* Python 2.5
* Java 1.6

[1] To run a game against a DualBot on map 5, run

$ ./dual.sh 5

Take a look at the log: MyBot.log


[2] To play all sample bots on all 100 maps, run

$ ./batch.sh

This will take a few minutes to run..

[3] To play other people's bots in REAL TIME without having to submit
your code to the contest server, compile TCP.java run

$ javac TCP.java 
$ ./tcp.sh

See http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/ for more details. 
Thanks dhartmei for setting up the server!

[4] To replay a game locally after is has been played on the server, run
replay.sh script and pass game page URL as a parameter. 
This is very useful for debugging your bot.

$ ./replay.sh http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4607627

Enjoy, and good luck on the battlefield!
